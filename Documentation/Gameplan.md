     - Parse and analyze WSJ or Yahoo Finance news articles related to specific stocks.
   - **Events Page:**
     - Display important monthly events (CPI, PPI, etc.) and analyze their historical impact on the market.

3. **Historical Analysis:**
   - Track historical standard deviation moves and subsequent stock responses.
   - Machine Learning (ML) integration to test hypotheses and generate alerts based on historical patterns, focusing on mean regression, earnings surprises, and event impacts.

4. **Integration:**
   - Use APIs for data retrieval (Yahoo Finance, Robinhood, OpenAI, Twitter, WSJ or Yahoo Finance for news).
   - Incorporate ML algorithms (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) for inferential statistics and alert generation.

5. **Implementation Approach:**
   - Develop a preliminary dashboard to start making decisions based on the collected data.
   - Use a React-based frontend and a Python backend.
   - Consider database and Kubernetes integration for data management and scalability.

### Updated Game Plan:

1. **Backend Development:**
   - Set up a Python environment for data processing and API integration.
   - Use Yahoo Finance API for historical stock data, news articles, and earnings data.
   - Use Robinhood API for real-time option contract data.
   - Use Twitter API for sentiment analysis and tweet parsing.
   - Calculate standard deviation moves, correlations, and analyze important monthly events.
   - Integrate OpenAI API for querying and hypothesis testing.

2. **Frontend Development:**
   - Develop a React-based frontend for the dashboard.
   - **Home Page:**
     - Display statistical data for SPY and QQQ along with option contract data.
   - **Stock Page:**
     - Search functionality to display statistical data, correlations, option chain, sentiment analysis, and next earnings details.
     - Display historical earnings data and analysis of EPS surprises.
   - **Account Page:**
     - Search specific Twitter accounts and display tweet analysis and sentiment.
     - Display parsed news articles related to specific stocks.
   - **Events Page:**
     - Display important monthly events (CPI, PPI, etc.) and analyze their historical impact on the market.

3. **Database Integration:**
   - Set up a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store historical and real-time data.
   - Implement data fetching and storage routines.

4. **Machine Learning Integration:**
   - Research and select ML algorithms/models for hypothesis testing and alerts.
   - Develop ML models focusing on mean regression, earnings surprises, and event impacts to analyze historical patterns and generate alerts.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Set up Kubernetes for container orchestration and scalability.
   - Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS).
   - Initially, get the application running on a local machine and then scale it on AWS or K8s.

### Next Steps:

1. **Backend Setup:**
   - Implement data fetching and processing routines for standard deviation moves, correlations, earnings data, and event impacts.
   - Integrate Yahoo Finance, Robinhood, Twitter, and OpenAI APIs.

2. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Develop the initial layout for the dashboard using React.
   - Implement data visualization for statistical data, option contracts, sentiment analysis, news articles, and event impacts.

3. **Database and ML Integration:**
   - Set up the database schema and integrate it with the backend.
   - Research ML algorithms/models for mean regression, earnings surprises, and event impacts and develop the models.

4. **Deployment:**
   - Set up Kubernetes and deploy the application on a cloud platform.
   - Test the application locally before scaling it on AWS or K8s.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Database Necessity:**
  Yes, a database will be necessary to store historical data, real-time data, and processed results for efficient retrieval and analysis.

- **Local Development:**
  Begin by setting up the application on your local machine, and once the core functionalities are working, move to deployment on AWS or Kubernetes for scalability.

### Implementation Plan:

1. **APIs and Data Sources:**
   - Use Yahoo Finance for historical stock data, news articles, and earnings data.
   - Use Robinhood API for real-time option data.
   - Use Twitter API for sentiment analysis.
   - Integrate OpenAI API for advanced querying.

2. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Focus on mean regression to identify outliers and predict rebound moves.
   - Analyze historical earnings data for patterns related to EPS surprises and stock movements.
   - Analyze the impact of important monthly events (CPI, PPI, etc.) on the market.

3. **User Interface:**
   - Simple, intuitive navigation in the React frontend.
   - Implement user authentication and account management later for personalized features.

4. **Deployment and Scalability:**
   - Preferred cloud platform: AWS.
   - Begin with local development, then scale using Kubernetes for container orchestration.
